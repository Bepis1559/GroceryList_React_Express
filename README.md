# React + Express

Run "git clone https://github.com/Bepis1559/GroceryList_React_Express.git." "Cd groceryList" and then "npm i ".
This is a small project for demonstrating React + Express knowledge . Please cd into groceryList and run the command "npm run dev" in order to start
the vite project. Then cd server and run the same command "npm run dev". Now you can add items with ids, which are saved via the express server. You check 
these items with the url "http://localhost:5000/items/" or http://localhost:5000/items/id , if you want to see just a particular item , based on its id.
"http://localhost:5000/ids" will return the total number of ids.
